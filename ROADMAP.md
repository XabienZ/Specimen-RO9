Current State (v1 Source Release)
- 	Custom model implemented
- 	Custom sound set configured
- 	Loot container created and integrated
- 	Source files published for community reference
- 	Licensing and documentation completed

Short‑Term Goals
1. Animation Pipeline Setup
- 	Prepare a clean, reproducible workflow for RO‑9 animations
- 	Establish a custom skeleton compatible with DayZ’s animation system
- 	Begin testing basic idle and movement cycles
2. AI Foundations
- 	Create initial AI class structure
- 	Implement placeholder behavior for testing
- 	Begin defining movement, detection, and aggression logic
3. Sound Expansion
- 	Add additional sound events (idle, alert, attack, death)
- 	Improve sound configuration and blending

Mid‑Term Goals
4. Full Animation Graph
- 	Build a complete animation graph for RO‑9
- 	Integrate locomotion, attack, hit reactions, and death states
- 	Test transitions and blending in‑game
5. AI Behavior System
- 	Implement full behavior tree
- 	Add patrol, chase, attack, and retreat logic
- 	Introduce environmental interactions (optional)
6. Encounter / Event Integration

- 	Add CE integration for dynamic encounters
- 	Optional: region‑based or trigger‑based spawns

Long‑Term Goals
7. Loot & Progression Expansion
- 	Add unique drops or crafting components
- 	Expand the RO‑9 loot container with progression‑based items
8. Variants & Evolutions
- 	Introduce visual or behavioral variants
- 	Optional: “elite” or “mutated” versions
9. Documentation & Tutorials
- 	Provide detailed guides for:
- 	animation workflow
- 	AI scripting
- 	model preparation
- 	CE integration
