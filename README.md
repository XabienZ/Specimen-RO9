# Specimen-RO9

A modular DayZ creature‑themed mod built around Specimen RO‑9, an experimental bio‑engineered entity designed for atmospheric encounters and future gameplay expansion. This repository contains the full source for the current version of the mod, including the model, sounds, configuration files, and the loot container associated with the specimen.

This project is being open‑sourced to support learning, transparency, and community collaboration as the creature evolves.

Current Features
🧬 Custom Model

A fully implemented model for Specimen RO‑9, prepared through a clean and reproducible export workflow.
(Note: This model is not original work; see Licensing section.)

🔊 Custom Sound Set

Unique audio assets configured for the mod’s ambient presence and interactions.
(Also not original work; see Licensing section.)

📦 Specimen Loot Container

A custom loot box associated with RO‑9, with configurable contents and CE integration.

Not Yet Implemented

To avoid confusion, the following systems are not included in the current version:

- 	No custom animations
- 	No custom skeleton
- 	No custom AI or behavior logic
- 	No encounter or spawning system

These components are planned for future development.

Project Goals
Specimen RO‑9 is intended as a long‑term exploration of:

- 	Clean, reproducible DayZ modding workflows
- 	Custom creature development
- 	Modular code and asset organization
- 	Community‑friendly transparency and collaboration

The repository is structured to help other modders learn from the process and contribute improvements.
